{"About:"}
{"I decided to make Scratch the main project language file for this project (SNU / 2D / Programming Tools / IDE / Scratch) as this is a Scratch IDE, and it needs its main language to be represented here. Scratch programs are stored mostly in JSON format, so JSON is in use here. It is getting its own project language file, starting here."}
